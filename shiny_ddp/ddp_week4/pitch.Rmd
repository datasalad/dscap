## What's MPG stands for?

*Fuel economy* can be expressed as Units of distance per fixed fuel unit.

Miles per gallon (mpg) is commonly used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada (alongside L/100 km). 

###Why MPG is important?

- It helps you save money on gas prices
- Higher mpg is better for the environment  
- Higher mpg makes your car more efficient

## The dataset for the analysis
In this analysis we used ```mtcars``` dataset in R. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
head(mtcars[,1:9])
```


## MPG Corellation with other variables

MPG is mostly correlated with the weight of the car, the number of cylinders and the type of transmission.
```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(mtcars)
```

## Summary

Higher mpg makes your car more efficient and  is better for the environment.
